# The Fully Custom Keyboard Project - #004

_i have been blursed with the knowledge that i can now create a custom keyboard
for myself..._

Now that I know a bit about PCB design (none in actual practice though), I have
realised that I can design my own keyboard.

This article covers only my initial ideas and designs, so nothing here should 
be taken as final.


## Requirements/wishes

For my ideal keyboard I have the following requirements & wishes:

* Mechanical keys
  * Preferrably optical
  * Hotswap-able
  * Low-profile (maybe exchangeable to high profile)
* Modular design
  * Double- or even maybe tripple-split
* Firmware customization
* Ergonomic
* Economic (I'd prefer to spend less than 500â‚¬ on it)
* Portable
* Pretty
  * RGB (or at least a single color)
* Repairable
* HUD
* USB passthrough / hub
